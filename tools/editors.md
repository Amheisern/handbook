## Editors

### [Atom](https://atom.io)

> A hackable text editor for the 21st Century

Atom, built by the [GitHub](https://github.com) team is a cross platform editor that is _hackable_ through the use of CSS and JavaScript. The editor is implemented in web technology so all of the tools we learn in class can be use to change and extend the editor.

There are a set of plugins we recommend for students at the start of their course. As we proceed through the class we will install more plugins as we add more skills.

_Plugins we recommend to start with (some of these are installed by default)_

- Makes Atom look more pretty
  - `file-icons` _adds fancy icons to the project file view_
  - `pigments` _improves color handling in files such as CSS_
- Makes your code look pretty
  - `prettier-atom` _formats your CSS and JS files to a nice standard. NOTE: Turn on 'format on save' in settings_
  - `formatter` _formats other files such as HTML_
  - `formatter-tidy` _handles HTML files better, including all HTML5 tags_
  - _NOTE_ If you install these, please run `brew install tidy-html5` in your terminal once.
- Points out typos/mistakes in your code
  - `linter` _shows typos/mistakes in code_
  - `linter-stylelint` _shows typos/mistakes in code_
- Generally helpful tools

  - `autocomplete-paths` _will show autocomplete suggestions of files in your project_
  - `color-picker` _nice color picker for defining color codes in files_

_How to [install plugins](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages/)_

- Select the menu option `Atom > Settings`
- Click the `Install` icon (with the `+` symbol)
- Type in the name of the plugin and press enter to search
