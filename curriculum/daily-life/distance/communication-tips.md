## Know the communication channels

Be sure to know where the primary tools of communication are and how to use them. During work hours, you should keep a pulse on these channels to listen and be aware of what is going on.

For this session, the main channel of communication is the cohort slack channel.

## Stay Social

Slack is awesome for communication and collaboration. But, a lot of our interactions are also social, from arguing about the best Star Wars movie to chatting about the big game, it is important to continue that social aspect.

Take advantage of various channels to talk about non work stuff.

## Context matters

When communicating over tools, context matters. Remember that who ever you are chatting with has _no idea_ what you have seen/done/talked about or know the tone that you are speaking in. Use words, emojis, gifs and other written ques to help better communicate what you are trying to say.

## Feedback loops

No one likes being ghosted. In person, we can give visual ques, such a nod or thumbs up when we get a message. Over tools, such as Slack, we need to adjust that feedback in the forms of short
"Sounds good" messages or reactions. Its good to over communicate than to under communicate.
