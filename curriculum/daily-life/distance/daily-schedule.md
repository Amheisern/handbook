# Distance Learning!

During the next few weeks, to help practice social distancing, we are running the course online. This document serves as documentation to help guide us through this new process

We are using Slack as our primary form of communication. Make sure to be signed in and able to receive notifications, as this may change.

**NOTE**: This may change at any time due to evolving circumstances, at the team's discretion.

**NOTE**: During this time, communication is the word of day. During times when teams are working remotely, such as this, it is essential to communicate. From the small victories to big questions to funny programming memes, staying active makes this easier.

**Reminder**: Slack has reactions. Slack reactions are an excellent way to signal that you have seen messages.

## Daily Schedule

### Stand Ups

These are going to be virtual. Stands up are going to be a question send in a Slack message asked by the instructor. Students are to give there response on the thread. Your response is how we are going to take attendance. You are not marked "present" until you answer the stand-up question. Answering should be done no later than 9:05. So we can transition into the warmup

### Warm-Ups

Warms up are the same; the instructor sends out a coding problem to work on, and review happens at about 9:45. This review is optional and takes place over Zoom.

### Lectures

Lectures will happen from 10 till noon, with a break, as usual. The lecture is going to take place over Zoom. The lecture is not optional, and you are going to be marked absent if you are not on the Zoom session.

### Lunch and Lab

This is unchanged, Lunch and Lab time is your time to get homework, projects and other tasks complete. There is online virtual support from the academics team. You are encouraged to use Slack, Meet, and other online collaboration tools to work together.

### Virtual Office Hour

The instructor is hosting a virtual office hour to answers questions. This will a Zoom meeting that will be posted in Slack. These are not required but are there for any all to ask questions and to hear other student's questions.
