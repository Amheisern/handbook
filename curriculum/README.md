TODO: A high level overview of our Web Development curriculum.

## [Web Development Fundamentals](./fundamentals/)

## [Front-end Frameworks](./front-end/)

## [Back-end Frameworks](./back-end)

## [Supplemental Resources](./resources)

Going through the course, students tend to ask for more content and resources than just the course material. We have compiled a list of useful resources for the students to help in learning more about development and being a developer. Event though these resources are not needed to be a good developer and a junior may not understand everything, they help juniors get exposure to new ideas and help start meaningful conversations with other developers.
