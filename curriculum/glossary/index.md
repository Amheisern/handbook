## soft tabs

When indenting content we can use a `tab` or a `space` - A `tab` is a single character that represents a configurable amount of space. Each tool, such as your editor, code browser like GitHub, or your terminal can use a different amount of indentation for each `tab`. Because of this many developers prefer to use `spaces` to indent their code. A `soft tab` is a set of spaces entered into a document when you press the `tab` key on the keyboard. So if your indentation is two spaces each, pressing `tab` with `soft tabs` on would just insert two `spaces`. This keeps indentation simple while also enforcing the amount of space used.
