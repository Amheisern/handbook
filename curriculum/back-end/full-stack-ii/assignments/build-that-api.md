# Complete the Circle

For this assignment, you will be re-creating an API that was used during `unit-ii` and re-create it using the language of your choice.

This will be due Sunday at midnight.

## Objectives

- work in groups on an API
- create an API that has the basic CRUD actions
- connect up a react app to an API

## Requirements

For this project, you will self-organize into groups, and select an API to re-create. After you create the API you will take an old react app and use the new API instead of the old API.

### Explorer Mode

In groups of 2 or 3, choose 1 of the following:

- [ ] Build the one-list api using the language of your focus. This should be a direct replica of [http://one-list-api.herokuapp.com](http://one-list-api.herokuapp.com). If you are a .NET student, use the built in swagger for documentation building and no not worry about recreating the style, just the functionality
  - [ ] Take the react app we built in class, and point that to this new API and get that working.
  - [ ] Be sure to the utilize all Create, Read, Update, Delete endpoints.

~ OR ~

- [ ] Go back to your `API explorer` homework and choose an API that was used. You need to re-create this API. Be sure to the double with your instructor on which one you selected.
  - [ ] If your API has only reading of data, built out the creating, updating and deleting of that data as well.
  - [ ] Hook up and extend your react app to use all the endpoints that you created.

### Adventure Mode

This is the last weekend to really focus on homeworks and reviewing concepts. Use that to your advantage.

- [ ] Go back to a old homework, from any unit and do the adventure or epic mode for that assignment. Re-Submit the repository of the project you worked on here, along with what you worked on.

### Epic Mode

- [ ] Further your capstone, but only after you have completed `Adventure Mode`
