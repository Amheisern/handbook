# Explore the Universe

To get warmed up to using complex data models, create a `universe explorer` similar to the [star wars API](https://swapi.co). There should be a simple admin site, as well as a few endpoints that can be used by a React app. 

This is a bigger assignment and is due Sunday at Midnight. We might continue to add more requirements as the week goes on. 

## Objectives

- Practice using complex data models
- Practice creating APIs 

## Requirements

Pick your favorite fictional universe and create a database to explore the people, places, and objects. This should have, at minimal two tables to start. 

For example, I can pick `Harry Potter` and create a `Harry Potter API`. In this API, I will create a `school house` table and `people` table, both with a searchable API endpoint, as well as an admin page to CRUD people and Houses.

You could pick from any fictional universe (Harry Potter, Star Wars, Star Trek, etc) or anything in the real world that follows that same idea, (sports teams, fraternities, charity organizations, etc)

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Create a minimum 2 table data model that have a relationship between the tables (1 to many or many to many)
- [ ] Create the following endpoints for each table
    - [ ] Search 
    - [ ] Create
    - [ ] Update
    - [ ] Delete

- [ ] Create a React app that called the above endpoints and manages the data

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Work on modeling your capstone project.
- [ ] Add more tables and relationships to model out more information.
- [ ] Add the endpoints and functionality to manage the tables.

### Epic Mode

- [ ] work on your portfolio.
