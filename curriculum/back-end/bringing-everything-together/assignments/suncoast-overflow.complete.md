As we explore the concepts of a full stack web app, a good way to practice is to duplicate an existing site. For this project you will be creating a copy of a site that you know very well, StackOverflow.


The finished product will be due Monday, so this will be a little bigger. This is the final push to complete this app. Do not let perfect be the enemy of done.

## Objectives

* Create a full stack web app, from Database, to API, to frontend, as well as styled
