- How to use a search bar to filter results? (adventure mode last night for movies project)
- What's the best way and where to store small snippets of data in React? E.g. I tried using 'let totalResults = resp.data.total_results', but for some reason could not reliably read the value from totalResults elsewhere in the 'return' section, so I ended up turning totalResults into a hook.
- Why is my Movies page no longer updating "sort-by" or "sort-order" after I enter a text search? And what is a good approach to debugging this (and in general) React application(s), since installing the React add-on for the browser (Components tab in inspector) does not seem to help.
  In 1989 Movie app, why wouldn't the JSON results array sort using setMovieData(resp.data.results.sort((a, b) => a.release_date - b.release_date))?

- 6.  Write a function rovarspraket() that will translate a text into a “rövarspråket”. That is, double every consonant and place an occurrence of “o” in between. For example, rovarspraket(“this is fun”) should return the string “tothohisos isos fofunon”.(I can’t process this question)
- Can you combine vanilla js with react? I feel like sometimes doing something vanilla js way makes more sense than react. Granted, that could be because I understand it better than React now.
- Transparency/opacity effects
- What's the best way to create image tiles, if one wants to maintain a uniform (and pixel-fixed) size gutter between all image tiles as well as between the page margins and the images, since when mixing absolute pixel values (for the gutter) with percentages (for the image widths) there seems to be no accurate way of using up all available (browser-width) space?
- Adventure mode color picker: Add a section that displays a css class that applies the current background color to an element, just like https://cssgradient.io/
