title: Hello, react
draft: true

#### Day One - Hello, react

- react name origin: reacts to its environment
- create-react-app
  - tool built by developers at Facebook to help you build React applications.
  - It saves you from time-consuming setup and configuration. Simply run create-react-app command to create and start a new react project.
  - `create-react=app name-of-your-app`
  - `yarn install` then `yarn start` since we are using `yarn` not `npm`
  - `localhost:3000` (browser)

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) vs [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
  - both are package managers
  - yarn is slightly better
- [Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html#components)
  - React components are small, reusable pieces of code that return a React element to be rendered to the page
- Props
  - attribute of a component
  - Most components can be customized when they are created, with different parameters. These creation parameters are called props.
- Rendering multiple components (i.e. map)
