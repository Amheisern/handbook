# PEDAC

This should part 1, if statements should be part 2. For this lesson, walk the student through problem solution heuristic called PEDAC.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what an algorithm is
- Understand the 5 parts of PEDAC

## Recommended Previous Knowledge

## Stand up

Since this is the second day, there is usually no stand up

## Warm up

Since this is week 1, this should be be handled by the soft skills team and be about Communication

## Slides

[Yes](./slides.html)

## Full Code Samples

No code examples, this is purely logic training

## Lecture notes

- Set up a simple sample problem that is non technical
  - examples
    - build a sandwhich
    - fix something not technical (wobbly chair, hole in the wall)
    - directions to a place
- break down the instructions into reall simple peices
- relate that back to how computers works
  - dumb but fast
- Walk through the slides, relating it back to example

  - P
    Understanding the problem
  - E
    Example Data
  - D
    understanding the shape of the data
  - A
    Create the algorithm
  - C
    Code with intent

- Go through a second example, using this method

- DREAM: would love to have them play games to practice this

## Possible Assignments

- None yet, but could be built out

## Recommended Practice:

- cup stacking games

## Next Lectures

- this should part 1, if statements should be part 2
