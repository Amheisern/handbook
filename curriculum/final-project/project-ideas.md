# Capstone project seed ideas

## General Requirements:

The capstone project is the final of the course. This project should be big in scope, but able to trimmed down to a [MVP (minimal viable product)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-the-hell-does-minimum-viable-product-actually-mean-anyway-7d8f6a110f38/). Capstones are not necessarily new ideas that are supposed to change the world. Even though your own ideas are accepted (and sometimes encourage, with instructor guidance), some of the best demo's did re-invent the wheel.

The capstone has X mains goals.

- The capstone provides you _practice_ on the skills that you have grow over the length course. During the course, you have built many projects, but on a small scale. The capstone projects allow you to built something at a bigger scale, and over a longer time line. This bigger scope will help reenforce key concepts.
- The capstone provides a vehicle to _show off_ the skills you have cultivated and want to grow upon further. This project is a great portfolio piece. As described in career support, employers love to see what you actually build. This helps showcase the skills you want to work on and grow on going forward.
