title: Capstone Projects Rundown
draft: true
---

The goal of the capstone project is to show off what skills the students learned during their tenure at SDG.  The core idea should be a bigger than a weekend project, but the initial scope should be limited. 


These dates are rough and approximate and can be fluid.


1. Elevator pitch,
    - assigned: end of week 6  
    - due: end of week 7
    - NOTE: should be done together as a group

2. WireFrames
    - assigned: middle of week 7
    - due: Beginning of week 8
    - [assignment](./wireframes.md) 

3. HTML, front end framework choice

    - due middle of week 9
    - [assignment](./build-html.md) 

4a. API Definition
    - assigned: middle of week 9
    - due: end of week 9 
    - NOTE: This is concurrent with designing the database. The students should already have an idea since they should know what all needs to be dynamic form having the HTML (mostly) completed
4b. Data Model to support API
    - assigned: end of week 9
    - due: start of week 10
    - NOTE: This should be talked about and assigned about when databases are discussed, so that data modeling is fresh in their heads.

    - assigned: beginning of week 10
    - due: middle of week 11
