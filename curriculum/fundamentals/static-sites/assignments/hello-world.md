title: Hello, World.

In your first assignment you will end up with a web page, no matter how simple, published on the web.

## Objectives

- Get to know your text editor
- Introduce yourself to working on the command line
- Publish a web page

## Requirements

- Have `git`, `hub`, and `node` installed. We should have done this together in class.
- All of your HTML (and CSS if you do _adventure_ mode) should be formatted cleanly and consistently
  (use your editor to your advantage).

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] If you have experience with existing HTML/CSS frameworks (bootstrap, bulma, etc) you may *not* use them for these assignments.
- [ ] Follow all of the setup instructions (See "Assignment Setup").
- [ ] Compose a short essay (just a couple paragraphs at most) about a hobby you either enjoy, or would like to learn
      about. We will be expanding on this page in future assignments, so pick something fun!
- [ ] Put your short essay into an HTML page, using appropriate semantic HTML tags. (See the link `HTML Tag Reference` below). Give your webpage a simple header
      and footer as well.
- [ ] Deploy your site.

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Research the `id` and `class` HTML attributes.
- [ ] Use valid CSS to style the page (in the neighborhood of a couple dozen CSS declarations).
- [ ] Use at least one image somewhere on the page.

### Epic Mode

- [ ] Create a full layout for your page (heading, navigation, sidebar, footer, etc.).
- [ ] Use more complex CSS selectors than we covered in class, e.g. attribute selectors or sibling selectors.
