## Anatomy of an HTML element

Let's explore our paragraph element a bit further:

The main parts of our element are:

1. The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the start of the paragraph is.
1. The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the end of the paragraph is. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error and can lead to strange results.
1. The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.
1. The element: The opening tag plus the closing tag plus the content equals the element.

## Active learning: creating your first HTML element

Edit the line below in the Input area by wrapping it with the tags `<em>` and `</em>` (put `<em>` before it to open the element, and `</em>` after it, to close the element) — this should give the line italic emphasis! You'll be able to see your changes update live in the Output area.

If you make a mistake, you can always reset it using the Reset button. If you get really stuck, press the Show solution button to see the answer.
