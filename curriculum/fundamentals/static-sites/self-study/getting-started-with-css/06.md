# Pseudo-classes

A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to the end of a selector, preceded by a colon `:`, which is used to specify that you want to style the selected element but only when it is in a certain state. For example, you might want to style a link element only when it is being hovered over by the mouse pointer, or a checkbox when it is disabled or checked, or an element that is the first child of its parent in the DOM tree.

## Examples

- [`:first-child`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:first-child) - represents the first element among a group of sibling elements.
- [`:focus`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus) - represents an element (such as a form input) that has received focus. It is generally triggered when the user clicks or taps on an element or selects it with the keyboard's "tab" key.
- [`:hover`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover) - matches when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. It is generally triggered when the user hovers over an element with the cursor (mouse pointer).
- [`:nth-child`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child) - matches elements based on their position in a group of siblings.
