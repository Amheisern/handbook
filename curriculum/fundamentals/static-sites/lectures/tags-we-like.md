# Tags We Like

There are many [tags available](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) in the HTML specification and it is a good idea to become familiar with as many of them as you can. However, there are a core set of tags that we will see used more often. We have gathered the list of these tags here with a description of where and how to use them.
