# Vocabulary

At its most basic level, CSS consists of two building blocks:

- **Properties**: Human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features (e.g. font, width, background color) you want to change.
- **Values**: Each specified property is given a value, which indicates how you want to change those stylistic features (e.g. what you want to change the font, width or background color to.)

A property paired with a value is called a _CSS declaration_. CSS declarations are put within CSS Declaration Blocks. And finally, CSS declaration blocks are paired with selectors to produce CSS Rulesets (or CSS Rules).

Before getting too deep in theory and written explanation, let's look at a concrete example.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My CSS experiment</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first CSS example</p>

    <ul>
      <li>This is</li>
      <li>a list</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

And the CSS file:

```css
h1 {
  colour: blue;
  background-color: yellow;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

p,
li {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

Combining these two gives us the following result:

Now lets take a look at the structure of these CSS Rules and Declarations.
