## Boolean attributes

You'll sometimes see attributes written without values â€” this is perfectly allowed. These are called boolean attributes, and they can only have one value, which is generally the same as the attribute name. As an example, take the `disabled` attribute, which you can assign to form input elements if you want them to be disabled (greyed out) so the user can't enter any data in them.

```html
<input type="text" disabled="disabled" />
```

As shorthand, it is perfectly allowable to write this as follows (we've also included a non-disabled form input element for reference, to give you more of an idea what is going on):

```
<input type="text" value="I am disabled" disabled>

<input type="text" value="I am enabled">
```

Both will give you an output as follows:
