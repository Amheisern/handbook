# Tic tac toe (Design)

With a partner,I want you to create a design for a tic tac toe game. Do not worry about writing code for the first level. I really want you to practice your technical design skills here and think about how you would code this.

## Objectives
- Working on designing an idea
- Work on collaboration about around technical ideas


### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Submit a full design of how to approach this problem. This should include:
  - a mock up (could be a picture of a drawing)
  - implementation details, such as how you are implementing each square
  - a list of events that you are listening to.
  - this should contain psuedo-code on how you are handling each event, and all game logic

TIPS:
- these designs should be so detailed that you could give them another group and they could implement it with only a few questions
- If any at anytime you want to validate a piece of your design, (algorithm, event hanndling, UI/UX) It never hurts to to create an _extremely simple_ website/app that proves/disproves your idea

Features to consider:

- [ ] As a user I should be able to see a tic tac toe board
- [ ] as a user, the game should alternate turns
- [ ] As a user, i should be able to click in a square and play either `X` or `O` depending on whose turn it is
- [ ] As a user, when I get three in a row, I should be told i won and the game should be over
- [ ] Create a `vs computer` mode, that picks a random square
- [ ] Modify your `vs computer` mode to follow a specific strategy (your choice)

### Adventure Mode
- [ ] Go back and improve or iterate on a back on a previous homeworks adventure or epic mode
- [ ] Take a swing at creating your tic tac toe game
- [ ] Have fun with the CSS by adding colors, animations and effects to make the game more enjoyable

### Epic Mode

- [ ] Using a Min-max tree, make your computer AI unbeatable
