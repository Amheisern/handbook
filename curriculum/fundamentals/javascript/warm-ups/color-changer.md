title: "Challenge: Random Color Changer"

## Explorer

Create a website that allows the user to click a button and change the background color to a random color.

Display the new color's hex triplet (e.g. `#76bcbb`) on the screen in an `h1` tag.

## Adventure

Make it so that, instead of the `<body>`'s color, it changes only a section on the page to a random color.

## Epic

Make it so that when clicked, it generates 5 random colors and displays all five (e.g. https://coolors.co/).
