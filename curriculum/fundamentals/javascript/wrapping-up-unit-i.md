# The Final Countdown

This assignment will pull together all the skills and ideas that you have learned for the past three weeks. This project is a bit bigger than usual and will challenge you on the core concepts we have learned over unit-i. For this assignment, you will solve three code katas, and recreate a simple website that uses an API for the data. [This is the website](http://sdg-astro-club.surge.sh/) you will make. This website should be responsive and as close as you can make it.

Since this is a more significant assignment, the pacing is critical.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate basic knowledge of some programming ideas
- using HTML, CSS and JavaScript re-create a simple website
- Recreate [http://sdg-astro-club.surge.sh/](http://sdg-astro-club.surge.sh/)

## Requirements

- Complete the three selected code katas
- Create an SDG Astro Club website using https://sdg-astro-api.herokuapp.com for the data

## Deliverables

- a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) containing the solutions to all three katas
- GitHub repository containing the HTML, JS, and CSS the website
- a URL to the deployed site.

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] complete the following katas
  - https://www.codewars.com/kata/filter-out-the-geese
  - https://www.codewars.com/kata/beginner-lost-without-a-map/train/javascript
  - https://www.codewars.com/kata/you-only-need-one-beginner
- [ ] replicate this site exactly (as close as possible) [http://sdg-astro-club.surge.sh/](http://sdg-astro-club.surge.sh/)
  - You should pull data from the API [https://sdg-astro-api.herokuapp.com](https://sdg-astro-api.herokuapp.com)
    - use [https://sdg-astro-api.herokuapp.com/api/Nasa/apod](https://sdg-astro-api.herokuapp.com/api/Nasa/apod) for the NASA picture of the day
    - use [https://sdg-astro-api.herokuapp.com/api/SpaceX/launches/upcoming](https://sdg-astro-api.herokuapp.com/api/SpaceX/launches/upcoming) for the upcoming launch data.
- [ ] deploy your site

## Advice

- Take this in small steps. I would do this in the following order: Katas, HTML, CSS, Picture of the day, and then Upcoming Launches.
- Commit early and commit often.
- Use Font-awesome for the icons. Attach this script to the bottom of your page, and you will be able to use the CSS to create the icons
