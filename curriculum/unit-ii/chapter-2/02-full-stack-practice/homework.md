# Let's see those pets!

Now that you have full-stack powers, you can now build apps that communicate with APIs that you have built. For this assignment, go back to your Tamagatochi Pet API project and build a React app that uses to allow the user to create and play with some pets!

## Objectives

- using React to build full-stack apps
- comminuting with APIs
- practice using state and components

## Requirements

- Build a React app that interacts with your Pet API project you build during week 4. The UI is up to you, but do not get bogged down with how it should look. Keep it simple.
- This project is a two-day project, so pace yourself and do not wait till the last minute. Be proactive.

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Wireframe out how you want your site to look. Keep it simple for adventure mode.
- [ ] Be able to create a pet, you should be able to give this new pet a name
- [ ] Be able to view all pets and select a pet to take care of.
- [ ] Once a pet is selected, let the user `play`, `feed` or `scold` the pet
- [ ] Be able to "put the pet up for adoption" (delete the pet)

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Capstone. Finish wireframes and start HTML and CSS

### Epic Mode

- [ ] Have fun with the UI. Add animations and other fun features of playing with pets
- [ ] Add a feature that "kills" the pet over time if not taken care of.
