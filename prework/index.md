# Summary

Welcome to the Suncoast Developers Guild pre-work. These resources are designed to get you ready for your cohort.

If you have never worked with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, or have minimal experiences with these technologies we _require_ you to focus on the [pre-work](09-prework) section and do the reading and exercises found within.
