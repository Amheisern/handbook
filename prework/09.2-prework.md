# Pre-work

Pre-work is material that ensures you have the necessary foundation required for the course. Starting learning before the program is like training for a marathon. You don't show up the day of the race and start; you need to train beforehand. In our program, your brain is the muscle that needs to train. This pre-work is training for your brain.

## Fundamentals and Front End Development

## Start with the HTML and CSS

Start with some HTML and CSS. HTML and CSS are the essentially what the web is all about. HTML and CSS are what the user sees and interacts with the most. Since these two languages are fundamental, this is the best place to get your feet wet.

## Add some life with JavaScript

JavaScript allows to create interactive and dynamic websites. This is what brings our websites to life. This will also help us learn the fundamentals of how computers run lines of code. JavaScript runs on the client side, which means the users computer. Every website that you have visited, uses JavaScript in some way.

## Back-end Focus

Next, let us continue our journey with the rest of what creates a website, the server. Websites are served from a web server running some back-end language, such as Ruby, Python, or .NET. During the course, you are studying a back-end language to learn more in depth. There are plenty of back-end languages to choose from. Each language has its strengths and weakness. We have chosen to focus on .NET. Check out these resources to get started

### Explore C\# \("c-sharp"\) & .NET

.NET is a robust framework built by Microsoft. .NET and C# is a common, flexible and ubiquitous language.
