# Stress Management

## Why is it important?

- Stress wreaks havoc on your emotional equilibrium & health
- Stress narrows your ability to think clearly, function effectively, and enjoy life
- Stress Management helps you break the hold stress has on your life, so you can be happier, healthier, and more productive

## Tip 1: Identify the sources of stress

- Easy to see stressor examples might be changing jobs, moving or relationship changes
    - To identify your true sources of stress, look closely at your habits, attitude, and excuses:
    - Do you explain away stress as temporary (“I just have a million things going on right now”) even though you can’t remember the last time you took a breather?
    - Do you define stress as an integral part of your work or home life (“Things are always crazy around here”) or as a part of your personality (“I have a lot of nervous energy, that’s all”)?
    - Do you blame your stress on other people or outside events, or view it as entirely normal and unexceptional?

## Tip 2: Practice the 4 A’s

- Avoid, Alter, Adapt & Accept
- Avoid unnecessary stress
    - Learn how to say “no.”
    - Avoid people who stress you out.
    - Take control of your environment.
    - Pare down your to-do list
- Alter the situation
    - Express your feelings.
    - Be willing to compromise.
    - Create a balanced schedule.
    Adapt to the stressor
- Reframe problems.
    - Look at the big picture.
    - Adjust your standards.
    - Practice gratitude.
- Accept the things you can’t change
    - Don’t try to control the uncontrollable.
    - Look for the upside.
    - Learn to forgive.
    - Share your feelings.

## Tip 3: Get moving

- Physical activity is a huge stress reliever and you don’t have to be an athlete or spend hours in a gym to experience the benefits. 
- Exercise releases endorphins that make you feel good, and it can also serve as a valuable distraction from your daily worries
    - Put on some music and dance around
    - Take your dog for a walk
    - Walk or cycle to the grocery store
    - Use the stairs at home or work rather than an elevator
    - Park your car in the farthest spot in the lot and walk the rest of the way
    - Pair up with an exercise partner and encourage each other as you work out
    - Play ping-pong or an activity-based video game with someone

## Tip 4: Connect to others

- Spend quality time with another human being who makes you feel safe and understood
- Keep in mind that the people you talk to don’t have to be able to fix your stress. They simply need to be good listeners.
- Reach out to a professional when you need more than just a friend

## Tip 5: Make time for fun / relaxation

- Don’t get so caught up in the hustle and bustle of life that you forget to take care of your own needs. 
- Nurturing yourself is a necessity, not a luxury.
- Set aside leisure time.
- Do something you enjoy every day.
- Keep your sense of humor.
- Take up a relaxation practice.

## Tip 6: Manage your time better
- Poor time management can cause a lot of stress. 
- When you’re stretched too thin and running behind, it’s hard to stay calm and focused.
- Don’t over-commit yourself.
- Prioritize tasks.
- Break projects into small steps.

## Tip 7: Maintain balance with a healthy lifestyle
- In addition to regular exercise, there are other healthy lifestyle choices that can increase your resistance to stress.
- Eat a healthy diet.
- Reduce caffeine and sugar.
- Avoid alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs.
- Get enough sleep.

## Tip 8: Learn to relieve stress in the moment
- The fastest way to reduce stress is by taking a deep breath and using your senses—what you see, hear, taste, and touch—or through a soothing movement.
- Viewing a favorite photo.
- Smelling a specific scent.
- Listening to a favorite piece of music.
- Hugging a pet.
- Find what works for you.
