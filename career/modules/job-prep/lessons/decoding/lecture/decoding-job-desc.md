  struggling with

## Good Job Description

- A good job description will delve into the duties to be performed by the employee, its purpose, and the scope of the work to be completed.

## Keywords

- A job description is the place to find the right keywords to use, as well as give you an idea of what the employer will look for in the right candidate.

## Job Duties

- Duties can vary wildly from job-to-job, even if the job titles are the same.

- Often listed in order from most important to least important.
 
- As you read through the job duties, make a list of the one you’ve done in your previous jobs


## Qualifications

- Preferred and Required qualifications
    - Education level
    - Work experience
    - Required licenses or certificates
    - Required skills

## Jargon and Buzzwords

- Words and phrases are often just buzzwords that recruiters and managers use in every job description
    - Passion, commitment, team player, responsibility, dynamic interpersonal skills, ability to work independently, detail oriented, and analytical skills.

## Jargon and Buzzwords

- Narrative: What story are they trying to tell you?
    - Who are they as a company?
    - What do they do?
    - Why do they do it?

- Characteristics: What features are they advertising?
    - Location
    - Beverages
    - Activities

## Spot a Fake Job Posting

- Avoid postings that sound too good to be true
    - Overly high salary for low skills level
    - Job posts that state no skills or experience required
    - Promise perfect hours, salary, and benefits

- If it truly were a perfect job, they would not need to advertise

- Avoid job postings that ask you to pay a fee
    - Legitimate recruiters are paid by employers, not by potential job candidates. 
    - A requirement to pay for training materials or web training seminars should also raise a red flag. A legitimate company will not require you to pay for your own training.

- Requesting your personal information
    - Ask for your personal information
        - Birth date, social security number, or mother’s maiden name
    - This is info you shouldn't have to give out until you've received a job offer—if you give them at all.

## Employers

- What do employers want?
    - Proof of work 
    - Ability to learn and grow
    - Individual and team projects
    - What value do you bring to their story?
    - Hungry, Humble, Smart

## Questions to Ask Yourself

- Can I grow at this company?
- Does this fulfill my passions?
- Is the salary worth my career move?
- Do my skills fulfill the requirements?
- Will I fit into the company culture?

## What Do You Want?
- What are you looking for in an employer? 
    - Flexibility options, location, company size, a fun office culture, or even a transparent leadership system. 
- Compare your wants/needs to the job description

## Ready to Apply?

- Do your homework ...
    - Did you find the narrative? Does it speak to you?
    - Dig a bit more into their work, code, and team
    - LI, GitHub, FB, Twitter, Meetups, and community
    - Put time into the application process
    - Update your resume to fit the position

- What is your last step... 
    - How does the employer want you to respond?
    - Make sure you've found out the company's preferred method of communication.
    - Don't plan to email a resume if the organization wants you to apply through its online job portal.
