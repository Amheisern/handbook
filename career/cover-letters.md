## Resumes

### Keys to a good resume

#### Key areas of Information:

Contact information

- Email
- Phone Number

  - Google numbers are great if you want to protect your personal number
  - Github link
  - Portfolio link

Summary

- This section should be a brief paragraph (three to five sentences) that shows the value you bring by highlighting your skills and a couple big career wins. But rather than labeling it a “summary,” simply use a headline that encapsulates your credentials.

Skills

- You’ll want to incorporate the right keywords so that your resume is optimized for application tracking systems

Professional experience

- Focus on your accomplishments rather than your day-to-day responsibilities

Education

- Simply write where you went college and your degree.
- It’s ok to move this towards the top if you have limited work experience and want to highlight your experience at SDG

Bonus:

- Volunteering and community service
- If you have room feel free to add it

## Cover Letters

### Look for the Narrative

- Decode a job listing to find the narrative
- What problem do they solve
- Make that the context of your cover letter
  - Understand the story
- Identify with it
  - How you add value

### Not There, Find It

- Search online resources
- Use the companies webpage, check LinkedIn
- The more you research a company the better you are prepared to write your cover letter

### Proof of Skill + Narrative + Recommendation x 10/week = JOB SUCCESS!
