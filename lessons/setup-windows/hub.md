Hub is command line helper for github. It allows for easy github manipulation
from our terminal.

From your terminal, run the following commands (current directory does not
matter):

## Installation

```shell
scoop install hub
```

## Post Installation

Start a new Powershell and enter the command:

```shell
hub api
```

This will ask for your `github.com username`, supply your username or email
address. Enter your `github.com` password. If you have two-factor auth enabled,
you'll have to enter an authorization code.

hub outputs a lot of text. If you get a "wall of text" similar to the output
below, then you have setup `hub` correctly.

```shell
