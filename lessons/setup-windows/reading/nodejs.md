# Node.js

Node is a runtime for javascript. This means that with node, we can run javascript on our machines without having to be in a browser

When working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript we will find many of the tools require, or are written in, JavaScript with node.

## Installation

Download the [node.js installer](https://nodejs.org/en/). If given a choice, choose the "Current" version (as opposed to the "LTS" version)
