# .NET Core

In order to create and run applications written in the `C#` language and the `.NET Core` environment we need to install some tools on our computer. The tool we need to download is called a `Software Development Kit`, or `SDK` for short. Microsoft provides a download to install and configure the `.NET Core` `SDK` for us.

## Installation

[Download the latest](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version of the `SDK`. This will download an executable installation program you must run.

If you are given the option, choose the one which says `.NET Core SDK` -- do **NOT** install the `.NET Framework`

During installation, if you are presented with any choices, simply select the default option.
