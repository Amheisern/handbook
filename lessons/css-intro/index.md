title: Intro to CSS

CSS is what allows us to make a webpage look the way we want it to.

By linking your HTML page up with a set of CSS rules, you can make your website
conform to a more visually appealing standard than black text on white
background. You can create large sweeping rules, like making all of the text
bright shiny blue and the background a daring shade of magenta, or you can be
more surgical and tell every element on the page specifically where to be and
how to look.

Often we will use a hybrid approach, telling this section to look like this and
this other section over here to have brighter text and a shadowy backdrop.
