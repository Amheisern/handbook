title: Chrome
---

We recommend using [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) during this
course.

We are going to be using Chrome's `Development Tools` feature extensively when
developing front end applications. Even if you do not use Chrome for your web
browsing experience, having all of your fellow students on the same development
tools will help.

## Installation

```sh
brew install google-chrome
```
