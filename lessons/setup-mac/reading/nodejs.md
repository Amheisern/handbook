Node is a runtime for javascript. This means that with node, we can run
javascript on our machines without having to be in a browser

When working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript we will find many of the tools
require, or are written in, JavaScript with node.

## Installation

```sh
brew install nodejs
```
