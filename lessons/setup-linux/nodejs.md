---

Node is a runtime for javascript. This means that with node, we can run
javascript on our machines without having to be in a browser

When working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript we will find many of the tools
require, or are written in, JavaScript with node.

## Installation

```shell
sudo apt install nodejs
```

```shell
echo "export NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=~/.npm-global" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
```
