Moving beyond CSS for styling, this lesson covers several CSS features to allow
us to control the overall flow and layout of a page.

In [Intro to HTML](/lessons/html-into), we discussed the topic of `block` versus
`inline` elements. These elements, coupled with the _Box Model_, allow us to
control the layout of elements on the page. In this lesson, we will discuss the
flow of a page and other `display` properties that will allow us to layout the
page.
