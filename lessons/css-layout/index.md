Moving beyond CSS for styling, this lesson covers several CSS features to allow
us to control the overall flow and layout of a page.

In [Intro to HTML](/handbook/curriculum/fundamentans/lessons/intro-to-html) we
discussed the topic of `block` versus `inline` elements. This, coupled with the
_Box Model_ allows us to control the layout of elements on the page. In this
lesson we will discuss the flow of a page and other `display` properties that
will allow us to layout the page.
