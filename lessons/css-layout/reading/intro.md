# CSS Layouts

In [Intro to HTML](/handbook/curriculum/fundamentans/lessons/intro-to-html) we discussed the topic of `block` versus `inline` elements. This, coupled with the _Box Model_ allows us to control the layout of elements on the page. In this lesson we will discuss the flow of a page and other `display` properties that will allow us to layout the page.
