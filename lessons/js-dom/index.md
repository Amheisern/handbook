In this lesson we will learn how to use JavaScript code to interact with our web
pages. Without JavaScript our browsers cannot manipulate page beyond the static
version present when the page is first loaded.

We will learn how to access the `Document Object Model` and use JavaScript to
read, add, change, and remove elements from it.
