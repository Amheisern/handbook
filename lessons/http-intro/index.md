title: Introduction to HTTP
---

In this lesson we will discuss some of the basic technologies and protocols that
enable the web-based applications we are going to create.

When we speak of the "web" we are mostly concerning ourselves with the HTTP (and
HTTPS) protocol. HTTP stands for the HyperText Transport Protocol and is one of
many internet standards goverened by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force).

However, before we can dive into the details of HTTP and how we will be
interacting with it we need to investigate some lower-level technologies that
make HTTP possible.
