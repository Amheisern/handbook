| Console                  | This is a term for your Terminal or Powershell when running and interacting with an application                                                                                                                                   |
| `Console.WriteLine("");` | Is a tool to interact with the user when coding a C# application. This can display important data or ask for information from the user. This will display whatever is written within the `""` and generate a new line.            |
| `Console.Write("");`     | Is a tool to interact with the user when coding a C# application. This can display important data or ask for information from the user. This will display whatever is written within the `""` and will _not_ generate a new line. |
| `Console.ReadLine()`     | Is a tool to wait for the users input and reads the input as a string. Generally assigned to a variable to store the response.                                                                                                    |
| `\n`                     | Is a special sequence that represents a blank line. This is generally used in a `Write` or `WriteLine` to format what is displaying to the user.                                                                                  |
