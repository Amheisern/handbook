title: Your Health - Self-Care for Developers
order: 1
---

Whether you are a student learning to write clean code, a full-time developer working with a team, or a freelancer starting controlling the projects you work on, it is essential to make sure you are taking care of your health. As our lives become more complicated, balancing work, family, friends, and other responsibilities, we forget about taking care of our own basic needs.

## What is Self-Care?

Self-care is being purposeful in ensuring that you have your needs met, both physically and mentally. Practicing self-care means that you are prioritizing yourself as much as you would, family, friends, and your career. (Or whatever else you consider necessary.)

## So how do you practice self-care?

Practicing self-care is as much about taking care of your mind as your body. 

 ### Watch what you eat
Fuel your body so it can work effectively by eating healthy meals and snacks. Also, you shouldn't skip meals because you are "too busy" or "just need to finish this last thing."  Keeping your body fueled helps your mind work more effectively, and no one likes to code hangry.

### Exercise / Take a break
Exercising doesn't mean you have to head to the gym, do a 5 mile run or sweat for hours. Even a short walk around the block can help. The goal should be to step away from your computer, give your brain a break, and allow your body to move. Moving helps avoid back pain, mental frustration, and breaks the monotony of the day.

### Stay hydrated
Keeping your body hydrated goes hand in hand with eating. "Drinking fluids is crucial to staying healthy and maintaining the function of every system in your body, including your heart, brain, and muscles." -- [Harvard Medical School](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-importance-of-staying-hydrated). It's easy to think you are hydrating because you are drinking something liquid, but a large amount of soda/pop or coffee doesn't always give your body what it needs.

Drinking water isn't always a high priority, sometimes checking out other ways to get the hydration we need can make staying hydrated easier. [The 5 Best Ways to Rehydrate Quickly](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-rehydrate):

- Coffee and tea
- Skim and low-fat milk

## Get enough sleep
> Getting enough sleep is essential for helping a person maintain optimal health and well-being. When it comes to their health, sleep is as vital as regular exercise and eating a balanced diet. -- [Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325353)

When your body is getting enough sleep, it can help increase your concentration and productivity. A lack of sleep can slow your learning process and could lead to making unnecessary mistakes. Your emotions can also run higher when you are tired, leading to stressed interactions with your family, friends, and peers. There is also a higher risk of increased Imposter Syndrome, Depression, and can affect your immune system.

## Eye Care
> "Computer Vision Syndrome, also referred to as Digital Eye Strain, describes a group of eye and vision-related problems that result from prolonged computer, tablet, e-reader, and cell phone use. Many individuals experience eye discomfort and vision problems when viewing digital screens for extended periods. The level of discomfort appears to increase with the amount of digital screen use." -- [American Optometric Association](https://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/caring-for-your-vision/protecting-your-vision/computer-vision-syndrome)

Developers especially stare at computer screens and other devices continuously throughout the day; this can lead to symptoms such as:
- eyestrain
- headaches
- blurred vision
- dry eyes
- neck and shoulder pain

So how do you help maintain the health of your eyes?

**Look Away** Taking a break and looking away from your computer can go a long way to helping protect your eyes. 

**Adjust your setup** Tilt the screen slightly to avoid reflections or glare, make sure the screen is not too close to your face and put the display either at eye level or slightly lower.

**Glare-blocking tinted computer glasses** There are a variety of frame styles with varying shades of tinting, and prices range greatly to help you find the right pair for you. 

**[F.lux](https://justgetflux.com/)** is a program that adjusts a display's color temperature according to location and time of day, offering functional respite for the eyes. F.lux reduces eye strain during night-time use, helping to minimize the disruption of sleep patterns.

**Get your eyes checked** Having your eyes checked on a scheduled basis will help identify problems early

## Hand Care
Sitting at a desk and working all day can strain your muscles and joints.

So how do you prevent computer-related injuries?

**Invest in an ergonomic keyboard** "The problem is that the monitor and keyboard of a laptop are very close together. To position the monitor at the right height for your back and neck causes you to lift your arms and shoulders too high. But to position the keyboard at the best height for your arms and shoulders, you must hunch your shoulders and neck to see the monitor." -- [Better Health](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/computer-related-injuries)

**Use a Mouse** An ergonomic mouse can help reduce strain on your wrists and hands. If you get a mouse, have your mouse at the same height as your correctly positioned keyboard and try to place it as close as possible to the side of the keyboard. Then use your entire arm, not just your wrist, when moving the mouse.

**Adjust your typing style** Do you hit the keyboard hard when typing? Try using a lighter touch to help reduce the wear and tear on your fingers and wrist.

**Mix up your work to relax your hands** Find other tasks that you can work on to give you a break away from the keyboard when doing those tasks time the time to allow your arms to relax and rest in a different position than you would at the keyboard.

**Stretch** Simple hand stretches can be done anywhere and just once a day or week will help prevent carpal tunnel

## Body Care

**Use a Standing Desk** If your office provides it, standing desks can be a great way to relieve pressure on your back and hips from sitting in a chair all day.
 
**Try [Chair Yoga](https://chopra.com/articles/chair-yoga-flow-for-all-levels)** Unlike Yoga poses you might be familiar with, chair yoga is all about stretching and moving while seated. Chair Yoga is a great alternative when you are in the office and need to help relax your posture.

**Take care of your Mind** Taking short breaks between spurts of productivity can provide essential mental rest for overworked minds. The [Pomodoro method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a system that breaks up 20-minute intervals with short periods of rest. It works exceptionally well since you set regular reminders to help you keep taking breaks.

**Take a Day Off** Between work, online tutorials, and side projects, it's easy to let programming consume large chunks of your 'off time,' including weekends and holidays.

## Have Fun
Development doesn't have to be all work and no play. Simple things like customizing your terminal, buying a colorful keyboard, or decorating your office space can go a long way.

## Seek a Professional
Sometimes taking care of yourself requires assistance. Seeking professional help does not mean you can't handle it yourself. Counselors are there to listen, provide support, and offer feedback when you need it most. Another added benefit is you have someone that is there to listen to you and only you.
