title: Web Development Program Pre-work
---

## Summary

Welcome to the Suncoast Developers Guild pre-work. These resources are designed
to help you get ready to be successful in the program.

If you have never worked with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, or have minimal
experiences with these technologies we _require_ you to focus on the
[pre-work](/handbook/prework/09.2-prework) section and do the reading and
exercises found within.

_NOTE:_ There are a number of required tasks found within these sections,
including several forms to fill out. Please take care to complete all of these
at your earliest convenience.
