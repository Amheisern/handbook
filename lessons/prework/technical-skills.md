This curriculum is designed to take you from knowing nothing to being a junior
software developer in a short time. While this is true from a software developer
skill perspective, coming into the course, it is highly recommended to have some
basic computer skills to help make your journey into software a bit less
jarring.

## Computer Management

Everything a developer does is focused around on editing files. You should be
comfortable with managing files from the finder/explorer. You should be
comfortable doing:

- renaming files
- changing file extensions
- moving files
- creating files
- opening files

Bonus points if you can do these from the terminal.

## Web Browsing

This course focuses on becoming a web developer. As such, some basic web
knowledge is highly encouraged. We do not expect you to be
[a Vint Cerf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf) but should be able to :

- knowing what the address bar is and how to use it.
- navigate to the website directly from the address bar
- create an account on a new website
- feel comfortable figuring out how to use a website
- Clear your cache

## Keyboard skills

Using a keyboard is fundamental to being a productive developer. A good
developer can use a computer without ever having to use a mouse. With that high
bar in mind, an excellent first step is to get used to using keyboard shortcuts
such as:

- opening a program using the keyboard
- cut/copy/paste from the keyboard
- switch programs from the keyboard
- typing with all ten fingers and without looking

Challenge: Try turning off/unplugging your mouse for a day see what happens and
how fast you can adjust to using the keyboard only.

## Terminal

Developers typically like working on the command line. The command is a [REPL]()
for running commands against the operation system. Running commands in this
manner can lead to a more using of our machines, as well as, eventually, enables
developers to write little programs, called scripts, to help automate some
tasks. Use a terminal to try to :

- navigate to your "Documents."
- create a director
- create a file
- open a file
- run a program
