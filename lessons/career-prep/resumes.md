So you are ready to start jumping into the job search. The first stop on your journey to your next job is your resume. So what information do you need to have on your resume?

# Resume Must-Haves

## Contact information
Giving employers and recruiters a method for contacting you is vital. You want to make sure you give more than one outreach method and links where they can see your work.

### Your Name
Use your full professional name; this is the name that your application is filed under and used when verifying information about you.

If you have a preferred name, it is recommended you still use your full name, but it ok to add your preferred name in parathesis if you choose â€”for example, Kathlyn (Kathy) Harrison.

### Email

Having a professional email address is vital. You want to keep in mind that an employer may this email to schedule an interview, send over an offer for employment, and any paperwork you need to complete. Here are some does and don'ts of email:

Do:
- Use a professional email address
- Use your first initial, last name, or full name if possible. 
- Create a custom domain if you want to match your email address to your portfolio

Don't:
- Use an email address such as "soccerdude98@hotmail.com", while it is personal to you, it doesn't appear professional. It also doesn't let your recipient know who is sending it, and it could end up in a spam folder.

Here are some examples of professional email addresses.
- First name only: kathlyn@email.com
- First name and last name, without punctuation: kathlynharrison@email.com
- First name and last name, with punctuation: kathlyn.harrison@email.com
- First name, last name, and middle initial, with punctuation: kathlyn.s.harrison@email.com
- First initial and last name: kharrison@email.com
- First and middle initial and last name: kmjohnson@email.com
- Custom Domain: kathlyn@harrisondev.io

***Note***: It is important to remember that *Dots* don't matter in Gmail addresses

### Phone Number

Having your phone number on your resume is essential to help employers reach you quickly. Employers having access to your phone number means that you should maintain a professional voicemail recording and keep your voicemail available for messages. You don't want a "full mailbox" to stop you from getting your dream job.

When it comes to listing your phone number on your resume, several different formats are considered acceptable: 
727-867-5309 | (727) 867-5309 | 727.867.5309

You can also choose to put a label in front of your phone number such as "Tel:", "Ph:", "Phone:", or "M:" (for mobile).

***Note:*** Google numbers are easy to create and useful if you want to protect your number

### Github Link

Adding your GitHub link to your contact information not only shows you know how to use GitHub, but it also gives employers and interviewers quick access to examples of your work. Listing is as *github.com/username* and making it a clickable link is acceptable and understood by other developers.

### Portfolio link
Similar to having your GitHub link on your resume, having a link to your portfolio gives employers, and interviewers access to your work. If your portfolio URL is too long for the space available, it is ok to use a [Bit.ly link](https://bitly.com/) for a better visual flow.

## Career Summary
This section should be a brief paragraph (three to five sentences) that shows the value you bring by highlighting your skills and a couple of big career wins. 

Here are some things to think about when writing your Career Summary:
- Grab a hiring manager's attention right from the beginning, remembering you have only 25 few seconds to make a good impression.
- Spend time developing a summary that immediately gets their attention, and accurately and powerfully describes you as a solution to their problems.

## Skills
Listing your skills on your resume incorporates the right keywords to optimize your resume for applicant tracking systems. Think of your skills as three possible categories:
Technical skills section
Relevant skills section
Additional skills section
Listing your skills, especially when changing careers, can help boost your resume and showcase your ability to work in languages a position requires. You don't have to list every minute skill you may have. Stick to skills that benefit the position or organization.

## Projects
It's essential to list your most relevant projects on your resume to communicate your experience and skills, but also to highlight hands-on examples of how you applied your capabilities to find a solution.

You can use your homework assignments or capstone project for this section if you are in the program or a recent graduate.

Need an example of listing a project:

**Project Name** | GitHub Link
- Skills Used: HTML, CSS, React, .Net
- Brief Description of the project (two-three lines)

## Professional experience
When starting to list your Professional Experience, you should list your most recent job experience first, then the job before that, and so on. There are some exceptions to this rule, but most employers are expecting your resume to follow this format.

So what information should you include?
- Name of the employer
- Your job title
- Years of employment
- List three to four bullet points describing your most impressive achievements in that position. Focus on your accomplishments rather than your day-to-day responsibilities.

***Note:*** The projects that you complete as a student at SDG can be listed as experience if you choose not to have a separate Projects section.

## Education
If you have a limited educational background, don't panic. Lucky for you in the development community, many organizations and teams need skill and a good fit over someone with a specific degree.

If you have a degree or other educational background, please include it, even if it is not related to what you are doing now. 

So what information should you include:
- Name of the school
- Location of the school
- Degree or Certificate obtained (if applicable)
- Field of study
- Graduation year (if applicable)
- GPA (Note: You may not want to include this if it's not above 3.4)
- Relevant honors or academic recognition, coursework, activities or other achievements obtained during your education
