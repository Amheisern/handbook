## Attributes

Elements can also have attributes, which look like this:

Attributes contain extra information about the element which you don't want to appear in the actual content. In this case, the class attribute allows you to give the element an identifying name that can be later used to target the element with style information and other things.

An attribute should have:

- A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes.)
- The attribute name, followed by an equals sign.
- An attribute value, with opening and closing quote marks wrapped around it.
