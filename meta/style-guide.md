title: Style Guide
---

This is a work-in-progress style guide for authoring content in this handbook.

## General

- The use of first-person should be avoided, e.g. "I recommend selecting the third option"
- All image or other embedded assets should be placed in an `assets` folder adjacent to the markdown document and linked with relative paths.
- All links to other pages in the handbook should use relative paths _without_ the `.md` extension.

## Assignments

- Follow the [assignment template](./assignment-template).
- Requirements should be stated in clear, _complete_ sentences, including punctuation.
