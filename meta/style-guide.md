# Style Guide

---

This is a work-in-progress style guide for authoring content in this handbook.

## General

- The use of first-person should be avoided, e.g. "I recommend selecting the third option"
- All image or other embedded assets should be placed in an `assets` folder adjacent to the markdown document and linked with relative paths.
- All links to other pages in the handbook should use relative paths _without_ the `.md` extension.
- Every directory with content should contain a `README.md` that acts as a summary, or table of contents for that section.

## Assignments

- Avoid use of temporal phrases like: "today, we discussed a new topic", or "in yesterday's assignment".
- Follow the [assignment template](./assignment-template).
- Requirements should be stated in clear, _complete_ sentences, including punctuation:
  > Put your short essay into an HTML page, using appropriate semantic HTML tags.
- Objectives may be stated as sentence fragments, without punctuation:
  > Create an event-driven user interface
