# Adding lecture notes to the handbook

First off, thank you for helping to create a better, more solid curriculum. The effort to document what we are doing helps all parties involved; the staff, the community, the current students, and yourself.

## Main goal

The main goal of this effort is to help fill the handbook with content. We, the SDG academics team, have set up a curriculum to take folks from nothing almost nothing, to being a new freshly minted developer. This process has proven to work and be powerful, but it only exists in a lecture format.

SDG is asking you to help us create documentation, and formalize our curriculum and turn lectures into notes to better help share the knowledge and to give not only students but also give the community better resources to learn.

## How

The course in its current format is 12 weeks long, with approximately 9 weeks of full-time lecture, that is roughly 108 hours of lecture, content, and knowledge. This is where you come in.

At this [location](./lectures-to-do.md), There is a list of all the lectures we need to have added to the handbook. Select the lecture that looks the most appealing to you and still outstanding. Use [these instructions](INSERT_LINK) Take this lecture, watch the video, and create lecture notes. These notes should follow [this format](INSERT_LINK). Don't worry too much about formatting or adding too much more than what is in the video. These notes should not be a for word dictation of what is said, but a written guide for the students to follow along with and have for a resource for homework and self-study.

When you are done with your notes, follow [these instructions](INSERT_LINK) to submit a pull request to the handbook. For this first pass, after you submit pull request, a member of the SDG team merges it and put in the content in the current, correct spot in the curriculum.

After this first pass, we will be able to contribute straight to the hanbook via pull request, but until we get more content and more structure, it will working closely with SDG staff.

Again thank you for your help.
