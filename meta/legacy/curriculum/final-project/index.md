title: Capstone Projects Rundown
---

## General Requirements:

The capstone project is the final of the course. This project should be significant in scope, but able to be trimmed down to a [MVP (minimal viable product)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-the-hell-does-minimum-viable-product-actually-mean-anyway-7d8f6a110f38/). Capstones are not necessarily new ideas that are supposed to change the world. Even though news ideas are accepted (and sometimes encourage, with instructor guidance), some of the best demo's did re-invent the wheel.

The capstone has 2 mains goals.

- The capstone provides you _practice_ on the skills that you have grown over the course. During the course, you have built many projects, but on a small scale. The capstone projects allow you to built something at a bigger scale, and over a longer timeline. This more significant scope helps reinforce fundamental concepts.

- The capstone provides a vehicle to _show off_ the skills you have cultivated and want to grow upon further. This project is a great portfolio piece. As described in career support, employers love to see what you build. This portfolio peice helps showcase the skills you want to work on and grow on going forward.

The goal of the capstone project is to show off what skills the students learned during their tenure at SDG. The core idea should be a bigger than a weekend project, but the initial scope should be limited.

   - due: end of week 7
   - NOTE: should be done together as a group

2. WireFrames

3. HTML, front end framework choice
   - assigned: middle of week 8

   - [assignment](/handbook/curriculum/final-project/build-html.md)

4a. API Definition - assigned: middle of week 9 - due: end of week 9 - NOTE: This is concurrent with designing the database. The students should already have an idea since they should know what all needs to be dynamic form having the HTML (mostly) completed
4b. Data Model to support API - assigned: end of week 9 - due: start of week 10 - NOTE: This should be talked about and assigned about when databases are discussed, so that data modeling is fresh in their heads. - [assignment](/handbook/curriculum/final-project/take-the-next-steps.md)

6. Start building Dynamic Front End

   - assigned: beginning of week 10
   - due: middle of week 11
   - NOTE: This is the final assignment, but by this time the students should be in full project mode.
