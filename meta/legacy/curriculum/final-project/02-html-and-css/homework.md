# Let's get visual!

With the wireframes created, we need to start breathing life into our application. The next step would be to create HTML & CSS. This is the next step because, remember, it all comes down to HTML. This is what the user sees

_NOTE_: Really take advantage of this time to make progress on your capstone. Time seems to speed up as we approach the final stretch.

## Objectives

- Create the HTML and CSS for the final project

## Requirements

- Using `app-app` to start implementing your HTML

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Create the HTML and CSS version of your wireframes. Stay as true as possible. This should focus on static HTML and CSS.
- [ ] No matter how far you get, submit what you have on Sunday night.
