Working remotely doesn't have to be a hard and isolating experience. Here are some tips and tricks to help

## Know the communication channels

Be sure to know the primary tools of communication and how to use them. During work hours, you should keep a pulse on these channels to listen and be aware of what is going on.

For this session, the main channel of communication is the cohort slack channel.

## Stay social

Slack is fantastic for communication and collaboration. However, a lot of our interactions are also friendly, from arguing about the best Star Wars movie to chatting about the big game -- it is essential to continue that interaction.

Take advantage of various channels to talk about non-work stuff.

## Context matters

When communicating over tools, context matters. Remember that who ever you are chatting with has _no idea_ what you have seen/done/talked about or know the tone that you are speaking in. Use words, emojis, gifs, and other written cues to help better communicate what you are trying to say.

## Feedback loops

No one likes being ghosted. Face to face, we can give visual cues, such a nod or thumbs up when we get a message. Over tools, such as Slack, we need to adjust that feedback in the forms of short
"Sounds good" messages or reactions. It is better to over-communicate than to under-communicate.
