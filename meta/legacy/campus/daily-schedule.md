# Distance Learning!

During the next few weeks, to practice social distancing, we are running the course online. This serves as documentation to guide us through this new process.

We are using Slack as our primary form of communication. Make sure you are signed in and able to receive notifications, as this may change.

**NOTE**: This may change at any time due to evolving circumstances, at the team's discretion.

**NOTE**: During this time, communication is the word of the day. It is essential to communicate when teams are working remotely -- from small victories, big questions, or funny programming memes, staying active makes this easier.

**Reminder**: Slack has reactions. Slack reactions are an excellent way to signal that you have seen messages.

## Daily Schedule

The schedule is staying the same, with some minor tweaks.

### Stand-ups

These are going to be virtual. Stand-ups are questions sent in Slack asked by the instructor. Students are to give their response on the thread. Your response is how we are going to take attendance. You are not marked "present" until you answer the stand-up question. Answering should be done no later than 9:05. So we can transition into the warm-up.

### Warm-Ups

Warm-ups remain the same -- the instructor sends out a coding problem. The review happens at about 9:45. This review takes place over Zoom.

### Lectures

Lectures happen from 10 till noon, with a break, as usual. The lecture is going to take place over Zoom. The lecture is not optional, and you are marked as absent if you are not on the Zoom session.

### Lunch and Lab

This is unchanged -- lunch and lab time is your time to get homework, projects, and other tasks complete. Online virtual support is available from the academics team. You are encouraged to use Slack, Meet, and other online collaboration tools to work together.

### Virtual Office Hour

The instructor is hosting a virtual office hour to answers questions. A Zoom meeting will be posted in Slack. These are not required but are there for any/all students to ask questions and to hear other students' questions.
