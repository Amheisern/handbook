## Lecture notes

Part 1:

- Start with a review of the deck shuffler, without classes
- build is slowly and PEDAC where possible
- encourage a ton of questions here

Part 2:

- Intro classes as a way to store semantically similiar data
- Create new Card Class
  - in its own file, same namespace
  - mention the namespace thing
- Define
  - auto-implemented properties
    - [source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties#auto-implemented-properties)
    - Cautain against going too deep here, this a "trust me" point
    - No need to go deep into backing propeties
  - class vs objects
- New a few cards, using the object initilizer
- Refactor the deck shuffle to use the Card class instead of a string for a card
- If the class feels good, introduce methods on a class
