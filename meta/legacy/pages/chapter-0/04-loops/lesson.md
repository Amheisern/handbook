Introduce students to the idea of loops. This is part 1 of 2. Part 2 is Arrays and lists

## Learning Objectives

- understand a Loop in programming
- understand a `for` loop
- understand a `while` loop

## Recommended Previous Knowledge

We do FizzBuzz as the example, this so teh students need to know about

- variables
- if statements
- Writing Data

## Stand up

Week 1 lecture, no stand up

## Warm up

Week 1 lecture, warm up is handle by the Soft Skills team, should be about ???? (time management?)

## Lecture notes

- Explain what is a loop is
- start with a better defination of a control structure
- Demostrate why loops are important
- For loops
  - basic defination
  - focus on iteration over a set range
- While

  - iteration over a unknown range

- Create [FizzBuzz](https://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest)

## Possible Assignments

Deck shuffler, after the Array lesson

## Next Lectures
