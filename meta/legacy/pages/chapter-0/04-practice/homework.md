## Objectives

- Build on your knowledge of HTML & CSS
- Implement, from scratch, a given design
- Use modern techniques layout pages.

## Requirements

- Recreate this site as close as possible

- As discussed in class, it is easier to start with the mobile look first and then create the desktop. Follow the requirements in order for this assignment.

- Remember, start with HTML first and get the content going.

- You should complete at least the tasks given for _explorer_ mode as listed below before turning in the assignment, as well as before attempting _adventure_ or _epic_ modes.
