# Intro to programming

This is the intro talk after the env set up.

## Learning Objectives

- what is a program
  - software is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work
  - those instructions are called an algorithm
  - use a programming language to describe the algorithm to the computer
- what is .NET
- the basic parts of a C# app
- What is a variable
- reading and writing data

## Recommended Previous Knowledge

Dev env should be set up. This should happen the same day after set up, or at least as soon as possible after setup.

## Slides

## Full Code Samples

use a `dontet new sdg-console` app to walk through the parts

(ignore the if statements)

## Lecture notes

- Define what a program is
- Define what a programming language is
- Define .NET
- create a new dotnet app
- Show where to put code and have code run, purposefully ignore the `using` and `namespace`
- Variables

  - what is a variable
  - variables have types

    - primitives
      - int
      - decimal (float and double)
      - bool
      - char
    - reference
      - string

  - basic data converstions (int.Parse, tryParse)

- Math
- String concatenation
