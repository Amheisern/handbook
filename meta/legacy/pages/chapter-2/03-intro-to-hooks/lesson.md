## Stand ups:

@channel Good Morning!!!! Welcome to Tace Tuesday :taco: ! For Stand up Reply to this message with your answer!

What is one specific question about React you have? Try not to be general like, "How to React", rather try be specific, like "Props still are a mystery to me" or "Calling APIs using axios".

## Warm up:

@channel Today's warm-up:

```
Create a simple react app for users to convert from one unit of measurement to another.

# Explorer Mode
- create a  website that allows users to type in a number of inches and shows the user the number of feet.
- The UI and UX is up to you, as always, start simple and then build-up
# Adventure Mode
- add the ability to go from feet to inches
- Add the ability to convert to any unit measurement (yards, miles, etc)
- Add metric system
# Epic Mode
- This challenge was inspired by https://unit-converter.karthikeyan.space/. Check that out and replication any features you would like.

```
