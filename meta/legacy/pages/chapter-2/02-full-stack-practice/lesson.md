# "Challenge: Dice Roller"

I have seem to have forgotten my dice set at home. Being the developers we are, lets make simple dice roller.

## Explorer

Create a React app that has a button, and when the user clicks it, it displays a random number between 1 and 6.

## Adventure

If you are table top gamer, you know there are [more dice](https://www.dieharddice.com/what-are-dnd-dice). Add to your page, the ability to roll the following sided dice:

- 20
- 12
- 10
- 8
- 4
- 100

Also, let the user see all their past rolls.

## Epic

- Let the user add a multiplier to roll several dice at once, and let the user add a modifier to the dice roll. For example, as a user I want to roll 3d10+3 (3 ten sided dice) and add 3 to that result.

- Try to refactor your code to be as DRY as possible. HINT: It can a be based off an array.

## Lesson
