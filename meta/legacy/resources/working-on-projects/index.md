There will be also be times when you will step away from your computer to go do other things. Between breaks, distractions and sleep, there will be times when you need to resume a project.

When you want to come back to a project the first question you need to answer is :

If you need to create the project [go here](handbook/resources/working-on-projects/create-new-project), else if you need to resume a project, [go here](handbook/resources/working-on-projects/continue-a-project)
