title: Demo day tips and tricks
---

Over the cohorts, we have found some tips and tricks to help students have a successful demo day. It boils down to 4 main points.

## Know your story

Your story is unique to you. You need to be able to talk about your own story, but also the story about your capstone. Why do you choose the project? What as it like making the app? Your audience wants to know your story. Be sure to be clear about your problem is and how your app solves that problem.

## Know your happy path

While you are demoing your app, you have plenty of really cool features, but know what is the absolute minimum to show off your app. People do not want to watch you type; they want to see the website in action. Do not add fluff, keep it focused on the one problem that your apps solves and let the demo flow naturally from there

## Know your codebase

Be able to talk about your code. Know what libraries, technologies, and packages you are using and be sure to talk about them. Be able to say your app is mobile friendly. You should know where everything in your app is and where it is happening in your code. When demoing, be sure to only use features that you know work. Avoid features that are incomplete.

## Know your audience

Demo day attracts people from all over the tech community. From project managers to developers, to friends and family, everyone you meet has a different story. Interact with who your demoing to know how to tailor your speech. This will take a little bit of practice, which you can get by showing your app to as many people as possible before demo day.
