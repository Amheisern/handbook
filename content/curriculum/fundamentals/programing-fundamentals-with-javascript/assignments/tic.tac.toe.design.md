# Tic tac toe (Design)

With a partner,I want you to create a design for a tic tac toe game. Do not worry about writing code for the first level. I really want you to practice your technical design skills here and think about how you would code this. 


## Objectives

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Submit a full design of how to approach this problem. This should include: 
  - a mock up (could be a picture of a drawing) 
  - implementation details, such as how you are implementing each square
  - a list of events that you are listening to. 
  - this should contain psuedo-code on how you are handling each event, and all game logic

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] As a user I should be able to see a tic tac toe board
- [ ] as a user, the game should alternate turns
- [ ] As a user, i should be able to click in a square and play either `X` or `O` depending on whose turn it is
- [ ] As a user, when I get three in a row, I should be told i won and the game should be over 
- [ ] Create a `vs computer` mode, that picks a random square
- [ ] Modify your `vs computer` mode to follow a specific strategy (your choice) 
- [ ] Have fun with the CSS by adding colors, animations and effects to make the game more enjoyable


### Epic Mode

- [ ] Using a Min-max tree, make your computer AI unbeatable
