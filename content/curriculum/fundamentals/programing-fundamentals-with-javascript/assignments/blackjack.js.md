- Create a single player black jack games that plays against the house. You  are free to create the UI however you want, but keep it simple for level 1.

- The UI should be as simple as you want to be. 

### Explorer Mode
- [ ] The game should start with a standard deck of playing cards (52) 
- [ ] The house should be dealt 2 cards, these should be hidden from the user until the house reveals its hand
- [ ] As a user I should be dealt a hand that contains 2 cards   
- [ ] The user should have a chance to hit (get another card) until they decide to stop or bust (the total is over 21 ), Aces are worth 11, not 11 or 1 
- [ ] when the user is done, the house will draw it's cards until its has more than 18 or busts
- [ ] If either the house or the player bust, then they lose automatically
- [ ] The page should then display the the winner. The winner is defined as who was closer to 21 without going over 
- [ ] there should be an option to play again, this should reset the hands and reshuffle the deck
- [ ] Add basic styling and formating, nothing too crazy
