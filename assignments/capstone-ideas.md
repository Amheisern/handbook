## General Requirements:

The capstone project is the final of the course. This project should be
significant in scope, but able to be trimmed down to a
[MVP (minimal viable product)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-the-hell-does-minimum-viable-product-actually-mean-anyway-7d8f6a110f38/).
Capstones are not necessarily new ideas that are supposed to change the world.
Even though news ideas are accepted (and sometimes encourage, with instructor
guidance), some of the best demo's did re-invent the wheel.

The capstone has 2 mains goals.

- The capstone provides you _practice_ on the skills that you have grown over
  the course. During the course, you have built many projects, but on a small
  scale. The capstone projects allow you to built something at a bigger scale,
  and over a longer timeline. This more significant scope helps reinforce
  fundamental concepts.

- The capstone provides a vehicle to _show off_ the skills you have cultivated
  and want to grow upon further. This project is a great portfolio piece. As
  described in career support, employers love to see what you build. This
  portfolio showcases the skills you want to work on and grow on going forward.
