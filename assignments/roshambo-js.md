### Background

See the wikipedia page about
[Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors)

### How to get started

- Get familiar with rock, paper, scissors if you haven't played before (or in a
  while)

  - See _Explorer Mode_ for the UI requirements

- Style the user interface
- Write out in English, ALL the steps the application needs to take
  - For example "When user one clicks on Rock, remember that user one chooses
    Rock"
- Start adding JavaScript to make your program to do the steps you described
  above

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] As a user I should be able to see three buttons for each player.
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to pick an option for each player.
- [ ] As a user, after each player makes their selection, I should be told who
      won and the game should be over.

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Create a `vs computer` mode, that picks a selection.
- [ ] Modify your `vs computer` mode to follow a specific strategy (your choice)
- [ ] Make your computer AI unbeatable
- [ ] Give the user a choice to player against the various computer levels or
      another player
- [ ] Have fun with the CSS by adding colors, animations and effects to make the
      game more enjoyable

### Epic Mode

- [ ] Your game is currently only 1 vs 1, add the ability to add more computer
      or users players to the game
