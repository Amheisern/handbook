### How to get started

- Get familiar with rock, paper, scissors if you haven't played before (or in a
  while)
- Draw out on paper/whiteboard/computer the rough design of your application
  - See _Explorer Mode_ for the UI requirements
- Start by placing all the HTML elements on the page
- Style the user interface
- Write out in English, ALL the steps the application needs to take
  - For example "When user one clicks on Rock, remember that user one chooses
    Rock"

### Explorer Mode

#### Part 1

> NOTE: Complete part 1 before moving on to part 2

- [ ] As a user I should be able to see three buttons for each player: Rock, Paper, Scissors
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to pick what to throw.
- [ ] After both players makes their selection, I should be told who
      won and the game should be over.

#### Part 2

- [ ] You have heard about _Rock, Paper, Scissors_, but have you tried
      [_Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock_](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors,_Lizard,_Spock)?
      Modify your game to allow the extra options!
- [ ] Have fun with the CSS by adding colors, animations and effects to make the
      game more enjoyable

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Your game is currently only 1 vs 1, add the ability to add more computer
      or users players to the game
