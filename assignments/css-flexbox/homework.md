title: Flexbox
---

Now that we have learned the power of flexbox we will apply it to the sites we are building. We'll also go back to a past assignment and see how flexbox would simplify our HTML and CSS.

## Objectives

- Build on your knowledge of HTML & CSS
- Use flexbox techniques layout pages.
- Implement, from scratch, a given design
- Understand HTML/CSS Layout
- Be able to place elements on a page where you want them.

## Requirements

- You should strive to implement the design as close as possible. This can be difficult, especially if you've never worked with HTML or CSS before. Do your best and remember that practice makes perfect.

- **Note**: You should complete at least the tasks given for _explorer_ mode as listed below before turning in the assignment, as well as before attempting _adventure_ or _epic_ modes.

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Revisit the `Expanding Your World` assignment and redo your CSS using flexbox where appropriate. Add, commit, and push those changes to your existing repository.
- [ ] Recreate the page 'The Daily Kitteh' using flexbox as closely as you possibly can. Use the same fonts, sizes, and colors. Feel free to use any cat photo you wish, just respect the relative size of the photo.
