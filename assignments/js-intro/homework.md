### Explorer Mode

### Part 1:

- [ ] Assign click events to the `update` buttons to update the corresponding values on the page. The score buttons should adjust the current score by a "hard-coded" value.
- [ ] Deploy your site.

### Part 2:

- [ ] Add a `if` statement to stop each team's score from going below 0.
- [ ] Add an `if` statement to stop each team's score from going above 21
- [ ] When a team gets 21 points, disable the buttons and display an message to the user of who won
- [ ] Add a `reset` button that resets the scoreboard back to the each team having 0 points and re-enables the buttons

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Add more CSS to the winning teams score to indicate who won.
- [ ] Implement a Quarter/Period Tracker that would be appropriate for the sport.
- [ ] Add some styling to make it more presentable. Have fun with it.

### Epic Mode

- [ ] Add a Timer that counts down automatically and updates the period/quarter appropriately.
- [ ] Save/load the information to local storage.
- [ ] Add anything else that your sport would have on its scoreboard (e.g. fouls, sacks, shots on goal, etc.).
- [ ] Improve the UX to help to make score keeping by your sport easier.
