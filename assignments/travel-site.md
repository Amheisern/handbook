Your team has been contracted by the city of St Pete to build out a site about
local tourism. Luckily for us, our team has a designer and has completed their
mocks up of what they envision the site to look like. Your task is, in small
groups (2-3) pair program and recreate the site as close as possible.

This is an in-class activity to help reinforce concepts and provide milage to be
more comfortable with CSS.

## Objectives

- Practice HTML and CSS
- Work on replicating a mock-up
  - [mobile](https://github.com/suncoast-devs/handbook/blob/master/curriculum/unit-ii/chapter-1/04-practice/assets/tourism-mobile.png?raw=true)
  - [web](https://github.com/suncoast-devs/handbook/blob/master/curriculum/unit-ii/chapter-1/04-practice/assets/tourism-web.png?raw=true)

## Requirements

- form small groups of 2-3
- recreate this website
- We will meet periodically to discuss progress, topics, and ideas. Keep an eye
  on slack.

### Explorer Mode

For explorer mode, work to recreate the site exactly

- [ ] Start with build the HTML, focus on semantics
  - [ ] [images are here](https://github.com/suncoast-devs/handbook/tree/master/curriculum/unit-ii/chapter-1/04-practice/assets/tourism-images)
- [ ] After you are happy with the HTML, build out the mobile view
- [ ] Build out the desktop view
- [ ] deploy your app

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] The color is interesting to say the least, change the color scheme to
      something you like better. Tools like
      [https://coolors.co/](https://coolors.co/) and
      [http://paletton.com/](http://paletton.com/) will help.

## Tips and Tricks

- This looks and feels a lot like our example from yesterday. Use that as
  inspiration.
- The site is live at [here](https://sdg-tourism.netlify.com/). You can use for
  inspiration or if you get stuck
- Even though we see the website from a top perspective, you can develop a
  site's sections in any order. If you get stuck on one section, move on the
  next
