# A Spooky Portfolio

For this project, we're going to be starting work on a portfolio website that you can improve over the rest of your career.

The font used is [Josefun Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans).

## Objectives

- Build on your knowledge of HTML & CSS
- Implement, from scratch, a given design
- Use modern techniques layout pages.

## Requirements

- Recreate this site as close as possible

- As discussed in class, it is easier to start with the mobile look first and then create the desktop. You will have an easier time if you follow the requirements in the order they are given.

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Recreate the [mobile UI](https://github.com/suncoast-devs/handbook/blob/master/curriculum/fundamentals/modules/html-css/projects/mobile.png?raw=true) - Remember, start with the content (text, images) and HTML first before worrying about styling.
- [ ] Update your site to be response for [tablets](https://github.com/suncoast-devs/handbook/blob/master/curriculum/fundamentals/modules/html-css/projects/tablet.png?raw=true)
- [ ] Update your site to be responsive for [desktops](https://github.com/suncoast-devs/handbook/blob/master/curriculum/fundamentals/modules/html-css/projects/desktop.png?raw=true)
- [ ] Deploy your site

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Head over to [here](https://halloween-portfolio-markdewey.netlify.com/). There are animations and hover effects that are not in the mockups. Implement those using only CSS.
- [ ] For the responsiveness of your images, if you used flexbox for explorer mode, now use css grids, if you grids, now use flexbox.

### Epic Mode

- [ ] Take the time to personalize the site with information about yourself, links to your projects, and your pictures.
- [ ] Keep it professional, but make it your own.
