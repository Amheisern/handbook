# Calculator Fun

Practice is key to gaining the mileage needed conquer programming. A very common practice problem is to recreate a working calculator. A basic calculator is a good exercise in using state, effects and components to create a powerful and robust UI.

## Objectives

- practice using components
- practice implementing a UI wireframe

## Requirements

Create a simple calculator that allows the user to add, multiple, subtract and divide two numbers. You implement this ui:

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Implement the Above UI using HTML and CSS inside a react app
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to add two numbers
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to add subtract numbers
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to add multiple numbers
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to add divide numbers
- [ ] The clear button should reset the current calculation

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Show the user their history in a list
- [ ] Be able to chain together results. As in, the user should be able to input `2 + 3 - 4 + 5` and get an answer
- [ ] Let the user use their keyboard in addition to the mouse

### Epic Mode

- [ ] using your systems calculator app as inspiration, implement as many features as you can, including, but not limited to scientific mode, exponents, orders of operations etc.

## Notes

- Take this in small steps just like we did in class. Start with the HTML, then CSS, then with basic functionality
