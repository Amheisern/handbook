# Iteration

Learning programming takes practice and the best practice is repetition. This exercise allows you time to work on the basics of .NET and how to apply that logic to solving problems.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

- Demonstrate understanding of iteration/enumeration
- Further your black jack game

## Instructions

1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/suncoast-devs/net-iteration) to your own account.
2. Change into your projects directory:
3. Clone your repository: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_NAME_HERE/net-iteration`
4. Change into your project's directory: `cd net-iteration`
5. Install the dependencies: `dotnet restore`
6. Open in your editor: `code .`
7. Start the test runner: `dotnet watch test`
8. Open `Iterations.cs` and work on functions until tests pass. Once you are done with a test, to move to the next one, remove `(Skip = "Remove to run test")` from the `Fact` attribute. There are a total of 10 questions
9. Commit and push your work to GitHub.
10. Turn in the URL to your GitHub repo.

## Explorer Mode

- All tests passing
- No linter warnings
- Turn in the homework using the URL to your repository on GitHub.

## Adventure Mode
