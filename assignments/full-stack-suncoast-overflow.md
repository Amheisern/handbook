title: Suncoast Overflow
---

As we explore the concepts of a full-stack web app, a good way to practice is to duplicate an existing site. For this project, you will be creating a copy of a site that you know very well, StackOverflow.

The finished product will be due Monday, so this will be a little bigger. Pace yourself

First, we need to the database schema and start to build the API for the core functionality

## Objectives

- Create a full-stack web app, from database to API, to frontend, as well as styled
- Practice working in groups

## Requirements

In groups of 2 or 3, create an anonymous question and answer site, that allows users to up-vote and down-vote questions and answers.

The core functionality is:

- [ ] as a user I should be able to view and search questions asked
- [ ] As a user I should be able to view a question and its answers
- [ ] As a user I should be able to post a question, this can anonymous, and should be for Explorer Mode
- [ ] As a user I should be able to answer a question
- [ ] As a user I should be able to up/downvote an answer
- [ ] As a user I should be able to up/downvote a question

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Create wireframes for your app. really focus on the MVP
- [ ] Create an ERD for the core functionality above
- [ ] Create API definitions for all the endpoints needed. This should include URLs, params, body, and return types.
- [ ] Create an API that supports your design
- [ ] Create the Client app application that uses your API

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Work on your capstone project
