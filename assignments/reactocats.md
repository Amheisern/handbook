The Octodex is a fun way to celebrate a powerful tool we use for development. In
that same spirit, recreate [this site](https://octodex.github.com/)

You'll identify the main `Component`s on the page and create React components
for each, breaking down those `Component`s into smaller ones as needed.

## Objectives

- Learn to identify parts of a web site as `Component`s
- Use `app-app` (GAMMA stack) to build a React project
- Understand and use React components

## Stretch Objectives

- Understand and use "props" in React

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Figure out the main components of the page. These will be the main
      components in your `<App>` component.
- [ ] Create your React app
- [ ] Your CSS should be in `index.css`
- [ ] You should have at _least_ two components...
- [ ] Use props to try to reuse components

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Place the definition of each Octocat in an `array` of objects and use
      `map` to generate the Octocat components

### Epic Mode

- [ ] Put the `array` of Octocats in an `octocats.json` file and `import` that
      into your app.
- _OR_
- [ ] Use the `fetch` API to retrieve the list of Octocats from
      [this api](https://sdg-octodex.herokuapp.com/) instead
