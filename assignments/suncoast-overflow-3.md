As we explore the concepts of a full stack web app, a good way to practice is to
duplicate an existing site. For this project you will be creating a copy of a
site that you know very well, StackOverflow.

The finished product will be due Monday, so this will be a little bigger. Since
you have a long to time to work on this, this project is a great portfolio piece
that can a clean and responsive UI, as well as clean code in the API.

It is recommend to start with wire frames, then go from there.

## Objectives
