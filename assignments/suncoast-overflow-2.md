As we explore the concepts of a full-stack web app, a good way to practice is to
duplicate an existing site. For this project, you will be creating a copy of a
site that you know very well, StackOverflow.

The finished product will be due Monday, so this will be a little bigger. Pace
yourself

Now that we have a database schema, and API definition, we need to start
implementation.

## Objectives

- Create a full-stack web app, from Database to API, to frontend, as well as
  styled
- Practice working in groups

## Requirements

In groups of 2, create an anonymous question and answer site, that allows users
to up-vote and down-vote questions and answers.

The core functionality is:

- [ ] as a user I should be able to view and search questions asked
- [ ] As a user I should be able to view a question and its answers
- [ ] As a user I should be able to post a question, this can anonymous, and
      should be Explorer Mode
- [ ] As a user I should be able to answer a question
- [ ] As a user I should be able to up/downvote an answer
- [ ] As a user I should be able to up/downvote a question

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Create an API that supports your design
- [ ] Create the Client app application that uses your API

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Work on your capstone project
