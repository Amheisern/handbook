title: Get SASSy
---

Today you explorer the wonders of SASS and SCSS. Now, with that new knowledge, I want you head back to an old project and update the CSS to use some of the cool SASS features you learned about today.

## Objectives

- Practice using SASS and SCSS

## Requirements

Starting from any past assignment with non-trivial styling, update the CSS to SASS (or SCSS, your preference).

Remember the addition of `node-sass` to the project's dependencies.

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Use Sass (or SCSS) for your CSS, explore and use the following features:
  - [ ] Variables
  - [ ] Nesting
  - [ ] [Functions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html)

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Use these Sass features:
  - [ ] Mixins
  - [ ] Inheritance
  - [ ] Break your styles into multiple files using `@import`
