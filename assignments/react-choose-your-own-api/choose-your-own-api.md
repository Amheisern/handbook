title: Choose your own API Adventure
---

In this assignment, you'll build a front end for an API of your choice

## Objectives

- Reinforce component architecture in React
- Reinforce reading of API documentation (some are great, and some are terrible)
- Creating and designing your own features for a web app

## Requirements

We're going to build a front end for an API of your choice. Choose one from [this list](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)

_NOTE_ You'll need to choose one with `Auth` being `No` or `apiKey` since we haven't covered `OAuth` authentication yet.

_NOTE_ You'll also need to check to see if the API will work from your browser. You can do a quick check by making a small `app-app`, doing an `axios.get` or `fetch` of one API URL and see if you get browser errors.

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Select an API and get it approved by your instructor.
- [ ] Read your API docs
- [ ] Use Postman to make some API requests to be familiar with the API and the data it returns
- [ ] Create a list of the features you are going to create and how they will work
- [ ] Design your User Interface
- [ ] Design your HTML statically in `App.js`
- [ ] Make it dynamic
- [ ] Use components when needed
- [ ] Deploy it and share it with friends

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Add multiple pages to your site.
- [ ] Add a second API
- [ ] Work on components and clean, well commented code.
- [ ] Work on other assignments you might be assigned as well. Career support or old adventure modes come to mind.
