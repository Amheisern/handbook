[`axios`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) is a third party library that makes working with remote APIs easier than using the built in `fetch` API.

## Objectives

- Reinforce JavaScript
- Learn `axios`
- Practice APIs

### Explorer Mode

- Read the documentation on `axios`
- Read the [SDG quick reference guide on axios](/lessons/misc-quick-reference/axios)
- Update all your `fetch` code to use the simpler `axios` style. Also use `async/await` as well, it works great with axios
