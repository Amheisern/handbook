# Week 13 Guide

Congratulates and Welcome to week 13.
I come bearing some ideas and jumping off points to help you keep coding every day. Coding every day is the best way to keep your skills sharp and to make getting that job a little easier.
If you are looking for project ideas

- Add a few “v2” features to your capstone
- Update your portfolio
- go back and rebuild a few homework assignments (or your capstone!) that you want to revisit now that you have more knowledge.
- go back and do epic mode for a couple of homework.
- Build a second capstone sized project
  Projects are a great way to build skills, If you want more code kata practice, check out.

  If you want more advanced topics to explore
- Test-Driven Development
- Design Patterns, such as Singleton and Factory
- Big O notation
- SOLID
- Functioning Programming Fundamentals ( monads, immutability, etc.)
- Serverless Sites
  If you want more technology, a few good next steps are:
- Razor
- Redux
- Azure/AWS
- Kubernetes
  To learn new technologies or topics, always build small sample projects demonstrating the idea.
  Even though I am outside for this week, I am around at odd times to answer questions and what not! Congrats on making it this far. You got this.
