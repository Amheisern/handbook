# Sample Questions

Technical interviews are skill that requires practice. We having gathered some sampe questions that we have heard are used, or have been used by community members in hiring.

When using these questions, be sure to understand the question being asked, as well as the answer and try to avoid using "canned answers"

## Tech Specific Questions
These are a healthy mix of technical level questions, spanning from entry to senior. So you probably won't know all the answers. And that is okay. Use these as a guide to see what kinds of things software developers are asked during interviews. When learning the answers, its important to not only know what is going on, but also to create some code sample to explore the concepts. 

For example, for `javascript` => `- Explain == vs ===`, create a small script that demonstrates to yourself, that you know they are mean, and not just pulling up text book answers.
