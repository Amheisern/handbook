# "Week 13" Survival Guide

Welcome to post-grad life! This should help serve as a guideline to how to approach the next couple weeks

## Job Search

Of course, your highest priority during this time is the job search.

### Job applications

Applying for jobs should be a good chunk of your time. During this its a good to keep a healthy pace for applying for jobs. We recommend at least 5 good job applications per week. A good application is one that is well put together, customized for the company. Check out your career support resources to remember what make a good application.

### Social Media

Social media is a powerful way to connect, meet and interact with tech community and also folks who are hiring.

Use LinkedIn to your advantage. Be sure that its up to date, have good recommendations, and is a polished profile.Once you have connected with folks on LinkedIn, reach out and send a message. There is nothing to lose, and you might gain a contact that could lead to an opportunity.

Slack is also a good way to keep active. Both on the student slack channel and [the community slack](https://suncoast-devs.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtNzY1NDAxMjk4NTYzLWUwZGQ4NjhjMmJiMmI5YTc4OGEzYjViMTgzNWQ1MGViZWI5MzI4NWRlNTAyMzljYjU1ZTNiYjkzZWY2YmI3NTE) channel. Both of these slacks will help connect you to other developers.

### Interview prep

At the end of the day, one of key parts of the job search is the interview. Because it is so important, it is key to be ready and prepped. Each interview is different and each company does the process their opwn way, but there are some strageties to prepare for the jounrey. Take advantage of the time, momentum and your peers to prep for this process.

Code katas are a great way to prop for technical interviews and white board problems.

We recommend:

Also, to help you prepare, you can use [this as a guide](https://suncoast.io/handbook/resources/interview-practice/sample-questions/) to what kind of questions you will see. Also, check out these [non-technical questions](https://suncoast.io/256c2a4148f006a3e15a55cf4075b048/behavioral-interview-questions.pdf) that might pop up.

## Continue learning and growing

You have come very far during the cohort; but your learning can't stop with graduation.

### Attending Meetups

Meetups are a great way to not only meet new people, but also learn new ideas and see what other people are working on. During the job hunt, we recommend 2-3 a week. When at these meetups, be an active participant; ask questions, talk to other people and thank the speaker in person afterwards. A good goal is to meet 3 new people at every meetup.

### Giving a tech talk

Understandably, this is a big leap, but it has a huge ROI. Giving a tech talk is an amazing experience. It doesn't have to be a huge conference, it can be crash course on campus, or a small meetup. When you give a tech talk, it forces you to learn a topic in depth enough to talk about it. They say that teaching an idea is the best way to learn yourself, and giving talks is the perfect example.

Not only will your knowledge grow, but a tech talk is a long commercial for you. It should that you are excited about tech, have passion for learning new ideas and can comminate what you are thinking.

### Continue Coding

**Coding every day is the best way to keep your skills sharp and to make getting that job a little easier.** Keeping your skills sharp is like going to the gym, its better to be consistent that to go in spurts.

| go back and rebuild a few homework assignments (or your capstone!) that you want to revisit now that you have more knowledge. |
| go back and do epic mode for a couple of homework.                                                                            |
| Build a second [capstone sized project](https://suncoast.io/handbook/curriculum/final-project/project-ideas/)                 |

You have a foundation of of web programming, to grow those skills start taking a took at these topics. To learn new topics, always build small sample projects demonstrating the idea, and then apply them to a past project.

### More technologies

You were introduced to only a sliver the tech world. One way to grow you abilities and knowledge is to start to dip your toes into other technologies. The best way to learn new technology is to walk through a tutorial, and then build a project using the new ideas.

You might be tempted to try to learn all the things after gradation, but only try to learn new technology if you are going after a job that is different from what you learned during the cohort.

### Give back!

As always, our [handbook](https://github.com/suncoast-devs/handbook) is open source and is always looking for contributors and this is a great way to help reenforce areas that you might be weak on.

## Final worlds of Wisdom

### stay active

Staying active and pro-active during the job search. This will help speed up the process and keep you occupied during your search.

### Be patience

This process takes time. That is an unfortunate reality of the hunt. Patience will be your best friend. Realize this is a process and companies are on a different time table than you. You want a job today, they need to fill the job in the next 4 weeks. Be patience and persistent and good things will happen.

### Daily cadence

Set up a schedule for yourself. Dedicate time to applying, coding and meetups. Schedules and planing only help if you keep to it. This will be

Again, congratulations for getting this far, be confident in what you know and what you can do.
