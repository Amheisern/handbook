# Week 13 Guide

Welcome to post-grad life! Again, great work getting here, you should be proud.

I come bearing some ideas and jumping off points to help you keep coding every day. **Coding every day is the best way to keep your skills sharp and to make getting that job a little easier.**

## Project Ideas

- Add a few “v2” features to your capstone
- Update your portfolio
- go back and rebuild a few homework assignments (or your capstone!) that you want to revisit now that you have more knowledge.
- go back and do epic mode for a couple of homework.
- Build a second capstone sized project

## Katas

Projects are a great way to build skills, If you want more code kata practice, check out.

## Advanced Topics

You have a foundation of of web programming, to grow those skills start taking a took at these topics. To learn new topics, always build small sample projects demonstrating the idea, and then apply them to a past project.

- Test-Driven Development
- Design Patterns, such as Singleton and Factory
- Big O notation
- SOLID
- Functioning Programming Fundamentals ( monads, immutability, etc.)
- Serverless Sites

## More technologies

With the wide range of ideas and technologies that was introduced, its a good idea to pick a few new techs to learn. The best way to learn new technology is to walk through a tutorial, and then build a project using the new ideas.

### Front end (JavaScript)

- Redux
- Typescript
- Progressive web apps
- Gatsby
- Next.js
- Electron
- React Native
- Web Assembly
- Angular
- Vue

## Back End (.NET and C# )

- Razor

- Blazor Server
- WPF
- Serverless
- Xamarin
- Worker Service
- Signalr

## DevOps

- Azure
- AWS
- Kubernetes
- Docker
