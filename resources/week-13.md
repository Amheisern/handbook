# "Week 13" Survival Guide

Welcome to post-grad life! This guide should help serve as a guideline on how to approach the upcoming weeks.

## Job search

Of course, your highest priority during this time is the job search.

### Job applications

Applying for jobs should be a good chunk of your time. During this, it's good to keep a healthy pace for applying for jobs. We recommend at least 5 quality job applications per week. A quality application is one that is well-put-together and customized for the company. Check out your career support resources to remember what makes a proper application.

### Social media

Social media is a powerful way to connect, meet, and interact with the tech community and also folks who are hiring.

Use LinkedIn to your advantage. Be sure that it's up to date, have good recommendations, and is a polished profile. Once you have connected with folks on LinkedIn, reach out and send a message. There is nothing to lose, and you might gain a contact that could lead to an opportunity.

Slack is also an excellent way to keep active, both on the student slack channel and [the community slack](https://suncoast-devs.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtNzY1NDAxMjk4NTYzLWUwZGQ4NjhjMmJiMmI5YTc4OGEzYjViMTgzNWQ1MGViZWI5MzI4NWRlNTAyMzljYjU1ZTNiYjkzZWY2YmI3NTE) channel. Both of these slacks help connect you to other developers.

### Interview prep

One of the crucial parts of the job search is the interview. Because the interview is essential, it is vital to be ready and prepped. Each interview is different, and each company does the process their way. Still, there are some strategies to prepare for the journey. Take advantage of the time, momentum, and peers to prep for this process.

Code katas are a great way to prop for technical interviews and whiteboard problems.

We recommend:

Also, to help you prepare, you can use [this as a guide](https://suncoast.io/handbook/resources/interview-practice/sample-questions/) to what kind of questions you might see. Also, check out these [non-technical questions](https://suncoast.io/256c2a4148f006a3e15a55cf4075b048/behavioral-interview-questions.pdf) that might pop up.

## Continue learning and growing

You have come very far during the cohort, but your learning can't stop with graduation.

### Attending meetups

Meetups are a great way to meet new people but also learn new ideas and see what projects and ideas people are working on. During the job hunt, we recommend 2-3 a week. When at these meetups, be an active participant; ask questions, talk to other people and thank the speaker in person afterwards. A good goal is to meet 3 new people at every meetup.

### Giving a tech talk

Understandably, this is a big leap, but it has a considerable ROI. Giving a tech talk is a fantastic experience. It doesn't have to be a huge conference; it can be a crash course on campus or a small meetup. When you give a tech talk, it forces you to learn a topic in-depth enough to talk about it. They say that teaching an idea is the best way to learn yourself, and giving talks is the perfect example.

Not only will your knowledge grow, but a tech talk is an extended commercial for you. It should ensure that you are excited about tech, have a passion for learning new ideas, and can comminate what you are thinking.

### Continue coding

**Coding every day is the best way to keep your skills sharp and to make getting that job a little easier.** Keeping your skills sharp is like going to the gym, its better to be consistent that to go in spurts.

| Project Ideas                                                                                                                             |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Add a few "v2" features to your capstone                                                                                                  |

| go back and rebuild a few homework assignments (or your capstone!) that you want to revisit now that you have more knowledge than before. |
| go back and do epic mode for a couple of homework.                                                                                        |
| Build a second [capstone sized project](https://suncoast.io/handbook/curriculum/final-project/project-ideas/)                             |

You have a foundation of web programming, to grow those skills start taking a took at these topics. To learn new topics, always build small sample projects demonstrating the idea, and then apply them to a past project.

| Advanced Topics                                                    |

### More technologies

Over the course, you are introduced to only a sliver in the tech world. One way to grow your abilities and knowledge is to start to dip your toes into other technologies. The best way to learn new technology is to walk through a tutorial, and then build a project using the new ideas.

| Other techs            | language             |

During this time, you might be tempted to try to learn all the things after graduation, but that might not be the best path to success. We would recommend only start to learn a new technology if you are going after a job that is different from what you learned during the cohort.

### Give back!

As always, our [handbook](https://github.com/suncoast-devs/handbook) is open source and is always looking for contributors, and this is a great way to help reinforce areas that you might want more practice with.

## Final words of wisdom

### Stay active

Stay active and be pro-active during the job search. This will help speed up the process and keep you occupied during your search.

### Be patience

This process takes time. That is an unfortunate reality of the hunt. During the job hunt, patience is your best friend. Realize this is a process and companies are on a different time table than you. You want a job today; they need to fill the job in the next 4 weeks. Be patient, and persistent and good things will happen.

### Daily cadence

Set up a schedule for yourself. Dedicate time to applying, coding, and meetups. Schedules and planning help you only if you keep at it.

Again, congratulations for getting this far, be confident in what you know and what you can do.
