Being proficient at the command line will save you a lot of time as a developer and help automate many of the tools we use on a day-to-day basis.

## OS X / Unix / Linux

Most of these tips will work in any Unix / Linux environment including OS X.

### Command History

- The `shell` contains a history of many of the past commands you have executed in your terminal. You can *avoid retyping* these commands in a few ways
  - *Up/Down Arrows*: Pressing the up and down arrows will scroll through the history of commands you have run. Pressing enter while at any of these will re-execute that command. You may edit the command using the left/right arrow keys or the backspace key.
  - *History Search*: Before typing anything at a blank prompt press *control-r* and then the first few letters of a past command you have run, this will search backwards for the last command you ran that had those letters. Pressing left/right will allow you to edit the command and pressing *enter* will reexecute it
  - *!!* Typing `!!` on the command line on it's own will re-excute the last command you run
  - *history* Typing the command `history` will show you the history of commands you have run (up to some limit)
